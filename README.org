* Purpose
GLGS is a small screen/event handling library that provides a thin
layer abstracting the details of configuring the screen and handling
input. Sort of a simple GLUT/SDL.
* Building
As of now, the build scripts only work on Mac OS X.
** IOS
The following command should build the library and the examples and install them in the IOS simulator directory.
#+begin_src sh
./mk-ios
#+end_src
** NPAPI
The following command should build the library and the examples and install them in the user's plugins directory.
#+begin_src sh
./mk-npapi
#+end_src
After building, try opening file:testplugin.html
