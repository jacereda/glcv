* Purpose
GLGS is a small screen/event handling library that provides a thin
layer abstracting the details of configuring the screen and handling
input. Sort of a simple GLUT/SDL.
* Building
As of now, the build scripts only work on Mac OS X.
** Targets
*** IOS
The following command should build the library and the examples and
install them in the IOS simulator directory.
#+begin_src sh
./mk-ios
#+end_src
*** Android
The following command should build the library and the examples and
install them in the Android emulator. The emulator must be running.
#+begin_src sh
./mk-android
#+end_src
*** NPAPI
The following command should build the library and the examples and
install them in the user's plugins directory.
#+begin_src sh
./mk-npapi
#+end_src
After building, try opening file:testplugin.html
* API
** Functions
*** Application hook
#+begin_src c
intptr_t event(const ev * e);
#+end_src
This is the event handling routine implemented by your application.
*** Screen properties
#+begin_src c
unsigned gsWidth();
#+end_src
Current screen width
#+begin_src c
unsigned gsHeight();
#+end_src
Current screen height
#+begin_src c
Mouse location
#+end_src
#+begin_src c
int gsMouseX();
#+end_src
Current X mouse position
#+begin_src c
int gsMouseY();
#+end_src
Current Y mouse position
*** Keyboard
#+begin_src c
int gsPressed(gskey key);
#+end_src
True if key is currently pressed
#+begin_src c
int gsReleased(gskey key);
#+end_src
True if key has just been released
#+begin_src c
int gsShowKeyboard();
#+end_src
On platforms that support it, show the on-screen keyboard
#+begin_src c
int gsHideKeyboard();
#+end_src
On platforms that support it, hide the on-screen keyboard
*** Logging
#+begin_src c
void gsReportV(const char * fmt, va_list ap);
#+end_src
Report a message (depending on the platform, it might go to a file).
#+begin_src c
void gsReport(const char * fmt, ...);
#+end_src
Report a message (depending on the platform, it might go to a file).
*** Events
#+begin_src c
int evType(const ev *);
#+end_src
Event type.
#+begin_src c
const char * evName(const ev *);
#+end_src
Event name.
#+begin_src c
int evWidth(const ev *);
#+end_src
Width for GSC_RESIZE events.
#+begin_src c
int evHeight(const ev *);
#+end_src
Width for GSC_RESIZE events.
#+begin_src c
gskey evWhich(const ev *);
#+end_src
Keycode associated to GSC_DOWN/GSC_UP events.
#+begin_src c
int evX(const ev *);
#+end_src
Mouse X position for GSC_DOWN/GSC_UP events.
#+begin_src c
int evY(const ev *);
#+end_src
Mouse Y position for GSC_DOWN/GSC_UP events.
#+begin_src c
int evArgC(const ev *);
#+end_src
Argument count for GSC_INIT events.
#+begin_src c
char ** evArgV(const ev *);
#+end_src
Argument array for GSC_INIT events.
#+begin_src c
intptr_t evArg0(const ev *);
#+end_src
First event argument, mostly internal.
#+begin_src c
intptr_t evArg1(const ev *);
#+end_src
Second event argument, mostly internal.
#+begin_src c
intptr_t gsInject(gseventtype, intptr_t, intptr_t);
#+end_src
Inject an event, mostly internal.
#+begin_src c
const char * keyName(gskey);
#+end_src
Key name for GSC_DOWN/GSC_UP events.

** Commands
*** GSC_NONE
Null event, must be ignored.
*** GSC_INIT
Called upon initialization, no GL operations should be performed at this stage.
*** GSC_TERM
Called befor terminating the application.
*** GSC_GLINIT
The OpenGL context has been established. Might be called several times.
*** GSC_GLTERM
The OpenGL context is going to be destroyed. Might be called several times.
*** GSC_UPDATE
This is your update routine, should be called at ~60Hz.
*** GSC_RESIZE
Called when the screen is resized. Might be called several times.
*** GSC_DOWN
A key/button has been pressed.
*** GSC_UP
A key/button has been released.
*** GSC_UNICODE
Called when the user enters text.
*** GSC_MOTION
The mouse moved.
*** GSC_CLOSE
The application is about to close.
*** GSC_INVOKE
Invoke method. The argument is available as evMethod().
** Queries
*** GSQ_NAME
Used to query the application name.
*** GSQ_LOGGER
Function to be used for logging. The returned function prototype should be:
#+begin_src c
void report(const char * appname, const char * string);
#+end_src

* Examples
** Simple example that just draws
#+INCLUDE: "test/simple.c" src c
** Complete example handling all queries/commands
#+INCLUDE: "test/test.c" src c
