* Purpose
GLGS is a small screen/event handling library that provides a thin
layer abstracting the details of configuring the screen and handling
input. Sort of a simple GLUT/SDL.
* Building
As of now, the build scripts only work on Mac OS X.
** Targets
*** IOS
The following command should build the library and the examples and
install them in the IOS simulator directory.
#+begin_src sh
./mk-ios
#+end_src
*** Android
The following command should build the library and the examples and
install them in the Android emulator. The emulator must be running.
#+begin_src sh
./mk-android
#+end_src
*** NPAPI
The following command should build the library and the examples and
install them in the user's plugins directory.
#+begin_src sh
./mk-npapi
#+end_src
After building, try opening file:testplugin.html
* API
** Functions
*** Application hook
**** intptr_t event(const ev * e);
This is the event handling routine implemented by your application.
*** Screen properties
**** unsigned gsWidth();
Current screen width
**** unsigned gsHeight();
Current screen height
*** Mouse location
**** int gsMouseX();
Current X mouse position
**** int gsMouseY();
Current Y mouse position
*** Keyboard
**** int gsPressed(gskey key);
True if key is currently pressed
**** int gsReleased(gskey key);
True if key has just been released
**** int gsShowKeyboard();
On platforms that support it, show the on-screen keyboard
**** int gsHideKeyboard();
On platforms that support it, hide the on-screen keyboard
*** Resources
**** const char * gsResPath();
Resources path
*** Logging
**** void gsReportV(const char * fmt, va_list ap);
Report a message (depending on the platform, it might go to a file)
**** void gsReport(const char * fmt, ...);
Report a message (depending on the platform, it might go to a file)
*** Events
**** int evType(const ev *);
Event type.
**** const char * evName(const ev *);
Event name.
**** int evWidth(const ev *);
Width for GSE_RESIZE events.
**** int evHeight(const ev *);
Width for GSE_RESIZE events.
**** gskey evWhich(const ev *);
Keycode associated to GSE_DOWN/GSE_UP events.
**** const char * evKeyName(const ev *);
Key name for GSE_DOWN/GSE_UP events.
**** int evX(const ev *);
Mouse X position for GSE_DOWN/GSE_UP events.
**** int evY(const ev *);
Mouse Y position for GSE_DOWN/GSE_UP events.
**** int evArgC(const ev *);
Argument count for GSE_INIT events.
**** char ** evArgV(const ev *);
Argument array for GSE_INIT events.
**** intptr_t evArg0(const ev *);
First event argument, mostly internal.
**** intptr_t evArg1(const ev *);

Second event argument, mostly internal.
**** intptr_t gsInject(gseventtype, intptr_t, intptr_t);
Inject an event, mostly internal.

** Events
*** GSE_NONE
Null event, must be ignored.
*** GSE_INIT
Called upon initialization, no GL operations should be performed at this stage.
*** GSE_TERM
Called befor terminating the application.
*** GSE_GLINIT
The OpenGL context has been established. Might be called several times.
*** GL_EVENT_GLTERM
The OpenGL context is going to be destroyed. Might be called several times.
*** GSE_UPDATE
This is your update routine, should be called at ~60Hz.
*** GSE_RESIZE
Called when the screen is resized. Might be called several times.
*** GSE_DOWN
A key/button has been pressed.
*** GSE_UP
A key/button has been released.
*** GSE_UNICODE
Called when the user enters text.
*** GSE_MOTION
The mouse moved.
*** GSE_CLOSE
The application is about to close.
*** GSE_INVOKE
Invoke method. The argument is available as evMethod().
