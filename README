1 Purpose 
----------
GLGS is a small screen/event handling library that provides a thin
layer abstracting the details of configuring the screen and handling
input. Sort of a simple GLUT/SDL.

2 Building 
-----------
As of now, the build scripts only work on Mac OS X.
* Targets 
  + IOS 
    The following command should build the library and the examples and
    install them in the IOS simulator directory.
    
      ./mk-ios
  + Android 
    The following command should build the library and the examples and
    install them in the Android emulator. The emulator must be running.
    
      ./mk-android
  + NPAPI 
    The following command should build the library and the examples and
    install them in the user's plugins directory.
    
      ./mk-npapi
    After building, try opening [file:testplugin.html]

3 API 
------
* Functions 
  + Application hook 
    - intptr_t event(const ev * e); 
      This is the event handling routine implemented by your application.
  + Screen properties 
    - unsigned gsWidth(); 
      Current screen width
    - unsigned gsHeight(); 
      Current screen height
  + Mouse location 
    - int gsMouseX(); 
      Current X mouse position
    - int gsMouseY(); 
      Current Y mouse position
  + Keyboard 
    - int gsPressed(gskey key); 
      True if key is currently pressed
    - int gsReleased(gskey key); 
      True if key has just been released
    - int gsShowKeyboard(); 
      On platforms that support it, show the on-screen keyboard
    - int gsHideKeyboard(); 
      On platforms that support it, hide the on-screen keyboard
  + Resources 
    - const char * gsResPath(); 
      Resources path
  + Logging 
    - void gsReportV(const char * fmt, va_list ap); 
      Report a message (depending on the platform, it might go to a file)
    - void gsReport(const char * fmt, ...); 
      Report a message (depending on the platform, it might go to a file)
  + Events 
    - int evType(const ev *); 
      Event type.
    - const char * evName(const ev *); 
      Event name.
    - int evWidth(const ev *); 
      Width for GSE_RESIZE events.
    - int evHeight(const ev *); 
      Width for GSE_RESIZE events.
    - gskey evWhich(const ev *); 
      Keycode associated to GSE_DOWN/GSE_UP events.
    - const char * evKeyName(const ev *); 
      Key name for GSE_DOWN/GSE_UP events.
    - int evX(const ev *); 
      Mouse X position for GSE_DOWN/GSE_UP events.
    - int evY(const ev *); 
      Mouse Y position for GSE_DOWN/GSE_UP events.
    - int evArgC(const ev *); 
      Argument count for GSE_INIT events.
    - char ** evArgV(const ev *); 
      Argument array for GSE_INIT events.
    - intptr_t evArg0(const ev *); 
      First event argument, mostly internal.
    - intptr_t evArg1(const ev *); 
      
      Second event argument, mostly internal.
    - intptr_t gsInject(gseventtype, intptr_t, intptr_t); 
      Inject an event, mostly internal.
      
* Events 
  + GSE_NONE 
    Null event, must be ignored.
  + GSE_INIT 
    Called upon initialization, no GL operations should be performed at this stage.
  + GSE_TERM 
    Called befor terminating the application.
  + GSE_GLINIT 
    The OpenGL context has been established. Might be called several times.
  + GL_EVENT_GLTERM 
    The OpenGL context is going to be destroyed. Might be called several times.
  + GSE_UPDATE 
    This is your update routine, should be called at ~60Hz.
  + GSE_RESIZE 
    Called when the screen is resized. Might be called several times.
  + GSE_DOWN 
    A key/button has been pressed.
  + GSE_UP 
    A key/button has been released.
  + GSE_UNICODE 
    Called when the user enters text.
  + GSE_MOTION 
    The mouse moved.
  + GSE_CLOSE 
    The application is about to close.
  + GSE_INVOKE 
    Invoke method. The argument is available as evMethod().
  + GSE_NAME 
    Used to query the application name.
