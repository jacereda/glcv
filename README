1 Purpose 
~~~~~~~~~~
GLGS is a small screen/event handling library that provides a thin
layer abstracting the details of configuring the screen and handling
input. Sort of a simple GLUT/SDL.

2 Building 
~~~~~~~~~~~
As of now, the build scripts only work on Mac OS X.

2.1 Targets 
============

2.1.1 IOS 
----------
The following command should build the library and the examples and
install them in the IOS simulator directory.

  ./mk-ios

2.1.2 Android 
--------------
The following command should build the library and the examples and
install them in the Android emulator. The emulator must be running.

  ./mk-android

2.1.3 NPAPI 
------------
The following command should build the library and the examples and
install them in the user's plugins directory.

  ./mk-npapi
After building, try opening [file:testplugin.html]

3 API 
~~~~~~

3.1 Functions 
==============

3.1.1 Application hook 
-----------------------

  intptr_t event(const ev * e);
This is the event handling routine implemented by your application.

3.1.2 Screen properties 
------------------------

  unsigned gsWidth();
Current screen width


  unsigned gsHeight();
Current screen height

  Mouse location

  int gsMouseX();
Current X mouse position

  int gsMouseY();
Current Y mouse position

3.1.3 Keyboard 
---------------

  int gsPressed(gskey key);
True if key is currently pressed

  int gsReleased(gskey key);
True if key has just been released

  int gsShowKeyboard();
On platforms that support it, show the on-screen keyboard

  int gsHideKeyboard();
On platforms that support it, hide the on-screen keyboard

3.1.4 Resources 
----------------

  const char * gsResPath();
Resources path

3.1.5 Logging 
--------------

  void gsReportV(const char * fmt, va_list ap);
Report a message (depending on the platform, it might go to a file)

  void gsReport(const char * fmt, ...);
Report a message (depending on the platform, it might go to a file)

3.1.6 Events 
-------------

  int evType(const ev *);
Event type.

  const char * evName(const ev *);
Event name.

  int evWidth(const ev *);
Width for GSC_RESIZE events.

  int evHeight(const ev *);
Width for GSC_RESIZE events.

  gskey evWhich(const ev *);
Keycode associated to GSC_DOWN/GSC_UP events.

  const char * evKeyName(const ev *);
Key name for GSC_DOWN/GSC_UP events.

  int evX(const ev *);
Mouse X position for GSC_DOWN/GSC_UP events.

  int evY(const ev *);
Mouse Y position for GSC_DOWN/GSC_UP events.

  int evArgC(const ev *);
Argument count for GSC_INIT events.

  char ** evArgV(const ev *);
Argument array for GSC_INIT events.

  intptr_t evArg0(const ev *);
First event argument, mostly internal.

  intptr_t evArg1(const ev *);
Second event argument, mostly internal.

  intptr_t gsInject(gseventtype, intptr_t, intptr_t);
Inject an event, mostly internal.

3.2 Commands 
=============

3.2.1 GSC_NONE 
---------------
Null event, must be ignored.

3.2.2 GSC_INIT 
---------------
Called upon initialization, no GL operations should be performed at this stage.

3.2.3 GSC_TERM 
---------------
Called befor terminating the application.

3.2.4 GSC_GLINIT 
-----------------
The OpenGL context has been established. Might be called several times.

3.2.5 GSC_GLTERM 
-----------------
The OpenGL context is going to be destroyed. Might be called several times.

3.2.6 GSC_UPDATE 
-----------------
This is your update routine, should be called at ~60Hz.

3.2.7 GSC_RESIZE 
-----------------
Called when the screen is resized. Might be called several times.

3.2.8 GSC_DOWN 
---------------
A key/button has been pressed.

3.2.9 GSC_UP 
-------------
A key/button has been released.

3.2.10 GSC_UNICODE 
-------------------
Called when the user enters text.

3.2.11 GSC_MOTION 
------------------
The mouse moved.

3.2.12 GSC_CLOSE 
-----------------
The application is about to close.

3.2.13 GSC_INVOKE 
------------------
Invoke method. The argument is available as evMethod().

3.3 Queries 
============

3.3.1 GSQ_NAME 
---------------
Used to query the application name.

3.3.2 GSQ_LOGGER 
-----------------
Function to be used for logging. The returned function prototype should be:

  void report(const char * appname, const char * string);
